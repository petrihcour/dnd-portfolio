        I create things that transcend the physical world, with
          equal focus on beauty and functionality. In my journey, there's a tale
          of perfect harmonies, blending my background in leadership, project
          management, and intricate problem solving with software development,
          resulting in a unique mixture of skills and perspective.

          Beyond coding, I'm a traveler seeking adventure far and wide across
          the Earth. I love experiencing live music, eating delicious vegan
          food, and (if you can't tell) healthily obsessing over my favorite
          pastimeâ€”Dungeons & Dragons.
